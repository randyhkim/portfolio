<h1>Background</h1>
Scavenging for internships during the pandemic, I had hoped my resume would be
a great way to impress myself to companies. The results found it to be futile.
That was when I decided to create a personal website. Though I do not expect
myself to become a full-fledged front-end developer, making something,
especially from the ground-up is exciting as an engineer. Not only would I be
expressing myself on the website, but I would also be learning web developing
skills that I probably would not learn any other way, and probably any other
time. So my goal for this project is to, in the end, learn skills, make a good-
looking portfolio, and, most importantly, have some fun.
